    This is the heart of the Vivarium Collective. Its modular interface
    allows for easy integration of systems biology models, and its
    simulation engine can execute the resulting composite model.

    This is a GitHub template repository, which can be used to start a
    new Vivarium project. It includes the module structure with example
    processes, composites, and experiments, and scripts to simplify the
    release of the project on PyPI.

    <code>COBRA_FBA</code> is a wrapper process for the COBRApy FBA
    library, which can be loaded with BiGG models, and has been
    primarily used with BiGG model iAF1260b. The project includes
    <code>CobraComposite</code>, which adds auxiliary processes
    <code>MassDeriver</code> and <code>VolumeDeriver</code> to make a
    type of dynamic FBA. Other processes can constrain individual fluxes
    in <code>COBRA_FBA</code> through the <code>flux_bounds</code> port,
    allowing for a type of integrative FBA.
