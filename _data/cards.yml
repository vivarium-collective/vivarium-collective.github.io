    This is the heart of the Vivarium Collective. Its modular interface
    allows for easy integration of systems biology models, and its
    simulation engine can execute the resulting composite model.

    <code>COBRA_FBA</code> is a wrapper process for the COBRApy FBA
    library, which can be loaded with BiGG models, and has been
    primarily used with BiGG model iAF1260b. The project includes
    <code>CobraComposite</code>, which adds auxiliary processes
    <code>MassDeriver</code> and <code>VolumeDeriver</code> to make a
    type of dynamic FBA. Other processes can constrain individual fluxes
    in <code>COBRA_FBA</code> through the <code>flux_bounds</code> port,
    allowing for a type of integrative FBA.
