    This is the heart of the Vivarium Collective. Its modular interface
    allows for easy integration of systems biology models, and its
    simulation engine can execute the resulting composite model.

    Vivarium Chemotaxis is a library for the model of <i>E. coli</i>
    chemotaxis. Its processes include <code>ReceptorCluster</code>,
    which models the activity of a chemoreceptor cluster, <code>MembranePotential</code>
    based on internal and external ion concentrations, and <code>FlagellaMotor</code>,
    which generates thrust and torque based on number of flagella and their motor states.

    <code>Lattice</code> is a composite model of a spatial environment in
    which these cells can grow, divide, and interact -- through physical
    forces as well as by uptake and secretion of molecules in a shared
    chemical milieu. It includes the processes <code>Multibody</code> for
    solid-body multi-cell physics and <code>DiffusionField</code> for
    diffusion of molecular concentrations in 2D fields.

    <code>COBRA_FBA</code> is a wrapper process for the COBRApy FBA
    library, which can be loaded with BiGG models, and has been
    primarily used with BiGG model iAF1260b. The project includes
    <code>CobraComposite</code>, which adds auxiliary processes
    <code>MassDeriver</code> and <code>VolumeDeriver</code> to make a
    type of dynamic FBA. Other processes can constrain individual fluxes
    in <code>COBRA_FBA</code> through the <code>flux_bounds</code> port,
    allowing for a type of integrative FBA.

    Smoldyn is a particle-based spatial stochastic simulator. Molecules are
    represented by point-like particles in 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional continuous space.
    Molecules diffuse by Brownian motion, react when they collide into each other,
    and interact with surfaces in a variety of realistic ways.

  text: >-
    Convenience Kinetics is a generalized Michaelis-Menten-style enzyme
    kinetics model, which can implement any enzymatic mechanism as a function
    of the enzyme, substrates, cofactors, and competitors. This formulation
    is especially useful for generating rate laws for arbitrary chemical networks.
    <code>ConvenienceKinetics</code> is a process that takes stoichiometry and
    kinetic rates as parameters, generates the rate laws, and runs them.
