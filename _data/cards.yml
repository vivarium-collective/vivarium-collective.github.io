    This is the heart of the Vivarium Collective. Its modular interface
    allows for easy integration of systems biology models, and its
    simulation engine can execute the resulting composite model.

    Vivarium Chemotaxis is a library for the model of <i>E. coli</i>
    chemotaxis described in <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/10/1101">
    Agmon & Spangler (2020) </a>. Its processes include <code>ReceptorCluster</code>,
    which models the activity of a chemoreceptor cluster, <code>MembranePotential</code>
    based on internal and external ion concentrations, and <code>FlagellaMotor</code>,
    which generates thrust and torque based on number of flagella and their motor states.

    <code>Lattice</code> is a composite model of a spatial environment in
    which these cells can grow, divide, and interact -- through physical
    forces as well as by uptake and secretion of molecules in a shared
    chemical milieu. It includes the processes <code>Multibody</code> for
    solid-body multi-cell physics and <code>DiffusionField</code> for
    diffusion of molecular concentrations in 2D fields.

    <code>COBRA_FBA</code> is a wrapper process for the COBRApy FBA
    library, which can be loaded with BiGG models, and has been
    primarily used with BiGG model iAF1260b. The project includes
    <code>CobraComposite</code>, which adds auxiliary processes
    <code>MassDeriver</code> and <code>VolumeDeriver</code> to make a
    type of dynamic FBA. Other processes can constrain individual fluxes
    in <code>COBRA_FBA</code> through the <code>flux_bounds</code> port,
    allowing for a type of integrative FBA.

    This is a template repository, which can be used to start a
    new Vivarium project. It includes the module structure with example
    processes, composites, and experiments, and scripts to simplify the
    release of the project on PyPI.
