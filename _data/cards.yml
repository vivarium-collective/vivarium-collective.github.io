    This is the heart of the Vivarium Collective. Its modular interface
    allows for easy combination of systems biology models and simulators, which its
    engine executes as integrative simulations.

    BioSimulators is a free registry of biosimulation tools. The simulators support a broad range
    of frameworks (e.g., logical, kinetic), simulation algorithms (e.g., FBA, SSA), and formats
    (e.g., BNGL, CellML, NeuroML/LEMS, SBML, Smoldyn). <code>BiosimulatorProcess</code> is a general-purpose
    wrapper for Biosimulators that adds the Vivarium interface, and allows multiple Biosimulators
    to be combined in hybrid simulations. <code>ODE_FBA</code> is a Composite simulator, that wires together
    any ODE-based biosimulator with any FBA-based biosimulator.

    ReaDDy is a particle-based reaction-diffusion simulator, with particle interaction potentials that permit 
    space exclusion, molecular crowding and aggregation to be modeled. Subunits are represented as spheres, 
    and molecules as a more complex geometries such as a domain structures or polymer chains.

    Cytosim is software for meso-scale simulations of cytoskeleton behavior. Physics are described by Langevin 
    equations that recreate the Brownian motion of the fibers and include bending elasticity, fiberâ€“fiber 
    interactions and external forces. Constraints are added to maintain the length of the fibers.

    Mechanochemical Dynamics of Active Networks (MEDYAN) is a software package for simulating active network 
    growth and dynamics with a reactive coarse-grained force field method. It is intended to be generally 
    applicable to model interactions of semi-flexible polymers embedded in solutions with complex 
    reaction-diffusion processes. One early application is modeling contractile acto-myosin networks consisting 
    of actin filaments, alpha-actinin, cross-linking proteins, and myosin IIA mini-filaments.

    Vivarium Chemotaxis is a library for the model of <i>E. coli</i>
    chemotaxis. Its processes include <code>ReceptorCluster</code>,
    which models the activity of a chemoreceptor cluster, <code>MembranePotential</code>
    based on internal and external ion concentrations, and <code>FlagellaMotor</code>,
    which generates thrust and torque based on number of flagella and their motor states.

    <code>Lattice</code> is a composite simulator for spatial environments in
    which cells can grow, divide, and interact -- through physical
    forces as well as by uptake and secretion of molecules in a shared
    chemical milieu. It includes the processes <code>Multibody</code> for
    solid-body multi-cell physics and <code>DiffusionField</code> for
    diffusion of molecular concentrations in 2D fields.

    <code>COBRA_FBA</code> is a wrapper process for the COBRApy FBA
    library, which can be loaded with BiGG models, and has been
    primarily used with BiGG model iAF1260b. The project includes
    <code>CobraComposite</code>, which adds auxiliary processes
    <code>MassDeriver</code> and <code>VolumeDeriver</code> to make a
    type of dynamic FBA. Other processes can constrain individual fluxes
    in <code>COBRA_FBA</code> through the <code>flux_bounds</code> port,
    allowing for a type of integrative FBA.

    Smoldyn is a particle-based spatial stochastic simulator. Molecules are
    represented by point-like particles in 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional continuous space.
    Molecules diffuse by Brownian motion, react when they collide into each other,
    and interact with surfaces in a variety of realistic ways.
